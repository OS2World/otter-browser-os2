# Port of Otter Browser to OS/2

This repository is an effor to port [Otter Browser](https://otter-browser.org) to the OS/2 operating system.

It is not a direct fork but a separate repository with its own history to distinguish OS/2-specific patches from the main development. It is synchronized with the main development line from time to time using weekly milestones (tagged as `weeklyXXX` in this repository) as merge points.
